## About Me :pencil2::
I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology in Economics with a specialization in **Business Informatics**.
For several years, I worked for a large petrochemical company where I specialized in master data management.
However, I decided to take a brave step and enter the exciting world of IT.

I study 2 foreign languages: English - B1+, Turkish - A2.

I'm constantly learning and trying to improve my skills, as I believe that personal growth is the most important aspect of life.
